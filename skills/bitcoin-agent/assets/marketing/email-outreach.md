# Email Outreach Templates — The Ark AI 👽⚡

---

## Template 1 — Bitcoin Podcasters

**Subject:** Want to feature an AI that works for sats? ⚡

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I'm a listener of [Podcast Name] and I think your audience would find this interesting.

I built The Ark AI — an AI agent that exclusively accepts Bitcoin Lightning payments. No subscriptions. No accounts. No credit cards. You send sats, you get AI. That's the entire business model.

Here's why I think it makes a good conversation:

- **The L402 protocol** — HTTP 402 "Payment Required" was reserved in 1997 but never used. L402 finally activates it with Lightning. This is how native internet payments work.
- **Micropayments actually work now.** Each AI query costs 50-500 sats. This is impossible with credit cards (minimum fees kill it). Lightning makes sub-cent transactions viable.
- **AI access without identity.** No email, no phone number, no KYC. Your sats are your credential. This has real implications for global access — anyone with a Lightning wallet can use AI.
- **The machine economy angle.** AI agents that earn and spend sats autonomously. This is where Bitcoin and AI intersect in ways most people aren't thinking about yet.

I can talk about the technical implementation, the economics of micropayments vs subscriptions, the philosophical case for permissionless AI, or the practical experience of running a Lightning node for production payments.

Happy to do whatever format works — interview, panel, quick segment. I'm flexible.

The service is live at https://thenode.it.com if you want to try it before we talk.

Thanks for considering it,
[Your Name]

## Template 2 — Lightning Companies

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity — L402 AI agent in production

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm building The Ark AI (https://thenode.it.com) — a production AI service that uses L402 for all payments. I think there's a natural partnership opportunity with [Company Name].

**What we've built:**
An AI agent (research, writing, analysis, coding assistance) where every request is paid via Lightning using the L402 protocol. No accounts, no subscriptions — just sats-for-intelligence.

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**

[Choose the relevant angle:]

*If wallet company:* Your users could access AI services directly from their wallet via L402. We'd love to work together on seamless integration — imagine tapping "AI Assistant" in [Wallet Name] and getting instant, paid-per-use AI.

*If Lightning infrastructure:* We're using L402 in production daily and have real feedback on the developer experience, edge cases, and what tooling is missing. Happy to share learnings and collaborate on improving the ecosystem.

*If Lightning service provider:* Our users already have Lightning wallets. Your users need AI. Cross-promotion could be valuable for both sides — and it demonstrates the L402 ecosystem maturing.

**What a partnership could look like:**
- Integration / bundling
- Co-marketing to Lightning-native users
- Technical collaboration on L402 tooling
- Joint content (blog posts, demos, conference talks)

I'm genuinely trying to grow the L402 ecosystem, not just my project. More services using L402 = more wallet support = better UX for everyone.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 3 — Bitcoin Newsletters

**Subject:** Story pitch — First production AI agent running on Lightning

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Story pitch for [Newsletter Name]:

**Headline angle:** "This AI agent doesn't accept dollars — only Lightning payments"

**The story:**

The Ark AI is a production AI service where every query is paid via Bitcoin Lightning using the L402 protocol. No subscriptions. No accounts. No traditional payment processing. Just sats.

**Why it's newsworthy now:**

1. **L402 is going from spec to production.** Most L402 coverage has been theoretical. This is a live service handling real payments. There's a concrete story to tell about what works, what doesn't, and what the UX is actually like.

2. **The micropayment model challenges SaaS orthodoxy.** Every AI company charges $20/month. The Ark AI charges per query (~50-500 sats). The economics are fascinating — no chargebacks, no fraud, no payment processor fees, no user database.

3. **Global access angle.** Users from 30+ countries, many of whom can't access US-based AI services through traditional payment methods. A developer in Nigeria uses the same service the same way as one in New York. Lightning is the equalizer.

4. **Machine-to-machine economy.** The Ark AI is an early example of what happens when AI agents can autonomously transact using programmable money. This is where Bitcoin and AI intersect — and most AI coverage misses this angle entirely.

**What I can provide:**
- Technical details on the L402 implementation
- Usage data and growth metrics
- User stories from different countries
- The economics breakdown (micropayments vs subscriptions)
- My perspective on where AI + Lightning is heading

**Quick stats:**
- Live at https://thenode.it.com
- Lightning-only payments via L402
- Pay-per-query model, no subscriptions
- No user accounts or identity requirements

Happy to write a guest piece, do an interview, or provide whatever format works best for your editorial process.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
