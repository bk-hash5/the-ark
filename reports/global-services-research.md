## Revenue Model Insight

**The power of micropayments:**
- A developer in Nairobi earning KES 80,000/month (~$600) can't justify $99/mo for Ahrefs
- But they CAN pay 1,000 sats ($0.10) for one SEO audit when they actually need it
- At scale: 10,000 users × 5 requests/month × 1,000 sats = 50M sats/month revenue
- That's meaningful revenue while being 100x more accessible than subscriptions

**Market size indicators:**
- 27M+ software developers globally (growing 25% by 2030)
- 70%+ are outside US/EU
- Fastest growing dev populations: India, Nigeria, Brazil, Indonesia, Kenya, Vietnam, Egypt
- These developers are underserved by Western SaaS pricing

**Competitive moat:**
- Lightning payments = no payment processor gatekeeping (huge in Africa where Stripe doesn't operate in most countries)
- Pay-per-use = no subscription fatigue
- AI generation = near-zero marginal cost per request
- Global accessibility = massive addressable market

*Total services cataloged: 55+*
*Average automation feasibility: ~90%*
*Key insight: The biggest opportunity is not competing with Western SaaS — it's serving the billions of people those tools have priced out.*
